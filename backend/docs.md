decoupling and stateless principles . - Deployed the Next.js frontend on S3+CloudFront for eޱcient
global delivery . - Integrated supporting services: EventBridge for events, SES for emails, with
thoughts on future analytics workްows. - Emphasized cost optimizations like serverless usage, right-sizing,
and monitoring . - Established CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for consistent and safe
deployments . - Outlined robust security measures (WAF, encryption, auth, auditing) to protect the
platform and users . - Explained the design of the NWT ledger in the database using double-entry
bookkeeping to ensure ޯ nancial integrity of the token system .
With this infrastructure in place, Nerdwork+ is well-prepared to launch and handle growth to the ޯ rst 10,000
users and beyond. The architecture can scale by increasing Lambda concurrency or ECS tasks per service,
adding read replicas or larger instances for the database if needed, and leveraging AWS’s managed services
to handle more load (e.g., moving analytics to Redshift or using Cognito for auth if user count grows, etc.).
Next Steps / Recommendations: - Infrastructure as Code: While we did everything manually here for
learning purposes, consider using tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to codify this setup. That
makes it reproducible and version-controlled. AWS CDK is another great option to deޯne infrastructure in
code (TypeScript/Python). - Monitoring & Observability: Set up dashboards in CloudWatch (or use third-
party like Datadog) to monitor key metrics: Lambda invocation errors/throttles, ECS CPU/memory, RDS CPU
connections, etc. Also set up alarms (e.g., on high error rate or low DB storage). - Testing the whole
system: Do an end-to-end test: register a user, simulate a token purchase, ensure the ledger entries are
correct, ensure an email is received, etc., to validate the plumbing. - Document and Train: Onboard other
team members by walking through this handbook. Keep documentation updated as architecture evolves
(maybe new microservices or refactoring from Lambda to containers, etc.).
This guide can be your reference as you operate and expand Nerdwork+. Keep an eye on AWS
announcements, as new services or features (like improved integration between API Gateway and ECS, or
cheaper serverless oޮerings) could further simplify or reduce cost.
By adhering to the structured approach and best practices outlined, you’ll ensure Nerdwork+ is not only
running successfully in the cloud but is also secure, maintainable, and poised to scale when user demand
grows.
Good luck with Nerdwork+, and happy cloud building!
