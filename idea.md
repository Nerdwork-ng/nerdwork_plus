erdwork+ is a comic-viewing web application (“comic microverse”) enriched with Web3 
features like crypto payments, NFT collectibles, and a loyalty rewards system. At a 0–10k user 
scale, the architecture emphasizes a modular microservices design to enable independent 
development, deployment, and scaling of features. The goal is to balance modern best practices 
(security, scalability, GDPR compliance) with cost-efficiency appropriate for a nascent SaaS 
platform. The following report details the microservices, their responsibilities, and how they 
interact via an API gateway and messaging. It also covers integration with AWS services 
(Lambda, ECS, RDS, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront, WAF, GuardDuty, SES), third-party platforms 
(Pinata for IPFS, Helio for crypto payments, Verxio for loyalty, Magicblock for NFT minting), 
deployment/DevOps setup, security architecture, data governance (GDPR readiness), cost 
optimizations, and real-world analogs (Mirror.xyz, Drip Haus) for reference. Short paragraphs 
and bullet points are used for clarity. 


Microservices and Responsibilities 
Nerdwork+ is broken into 10 core microservices, each handling a specific domain. This 
separation follows the single responsibility principle and fosters loose coupling. Each service 
owns its own data and logic, communicating with others only through APIs or asynchronous 
messages. Below is an overview of each microservice and its primary responsibilities: 
1. Auth Service 
Handles authentication and authorization for the platform. It manages user login, signup, logout, 
password resets, and token issuance. The Auth service issues JWTs or session tokens that 
other services validate for access control. It may integrate with a managed identity provider (e.g. 
Amazon Cognito) to offload user management and leverage built-in security features (Cognito 
offers features like secure password storage, MFA, and 10k monthly active users free in its tier). 
Key responsibilities: ensuring only authenticated users can access protected API routes, 
providing role-based access (e.g. admin vs. regular user), and protecting against unauthorized 
access (through measures like account lockouts and OAuth2/OpenID Connect if applicable). 
This service stores minimal personal data (credentials, auth tokens) and offloads as much 
sensitive logic as possible to secure libraries or managed services. 
2. User Service 
Manages user profiles and account data beyond authentication. This includes user details 
(display name, avatar URL, preferences), profile settings, and possibly social features 
(followers, user collections of favorite comics, etc.). It works closely with Auth service – for 
example, after Auth validates a user, the User service provides profile info. The User service is 
also the source of truth for user metadata like loyalty tier, accumulated points (it may fetch these 
from the Loyalty service or cache them), and any NFT ownership records relevant to the user’s 
profile. Data is stored in a relational database table (or separate schema) for users, likely in 
Amazon RDS (Aurora MySQL/Postgres) for strong consistency on profile updates. By 
separating user profile concerns from authentication, Nerdwork+ can scale or modify 
profile-related features (like adding bio info, social links, etc.) without touching core auth logic. 
3. Comic Service 
The comic content service is the heart of the platform, responsible for storing and retrieving 
comic data. It manages the catalog of comics (titles, descriptions, creators), chapters or issues, 
and pages. When a user wants to read a comic, this service handles content delivery logic: 
fetching page images or text (likely from the File service or S3), enforcing any access rules (for 
example, if certain comics require purchase or NFT ownership to view), and tracking read 
progress. Creators use the Comic service (via admin APIs or UI) to publish new comics or 
issues. It might maintain relational data such as comic metadata, relationships (which user is the 
creator, categories or tags), and perhaps ratings or comments (though those could be a 
separate microservice if expanded). The Comic service ensures a smooth reading experience 
by integrating with the CDN – e.g. providing CloudFront URLs for images – and might generate 
pre-signed S3 links if direct access is needed. It may also emit events to other services: for 
instance, sending a “comic_read” event to the Loyalty service (to award XP for reading) and to 
Analytics (to log engagement metrics). 
4. File Service 
Provides file storage and retrieval capabilities for the platform. This service abstracts away 
direct interactions with storage backends. When comics or images are uploaded (by creators for 
new issues, or by users for avatars), the File service handles the upload process, virus scanning 
(if needed), image processing (e.g. creating thumbnails), and then stores the files in Amazon 
S3. It returns the stored file URLs (which are served via CloudFront for performance). 
Additionally, the File service integrates with Pinata (IPFS) for decentralized storage: important 
content such as NFT metadata JSON or unique comic collectibles can be pinned to IPFS 
through Pinata’s API for permanence. Pinata provides scalable IPFS infrastructure for apps. The 
File service might store IPFS CIDs (content identifiers) alongside S3 URLs in its database, 
enabling Nerdwork+ to reference content on-chain if needed (e.g. linking an NFT to its metadata 
on IPFS). By centralizing file handling, this service enforces consistent policies: all files go 
through the same pipeline, are stored securely, and are accessible with proper permissions. It 
also facilitates future features like content moderation or watermarking by having a single 
chokepoint for file interactions. 
5. Wallet Service 
Manages users’ crypto wallet information and on-chain interactions within the platform. Users 
can link their crypto wallets (e.g. a Solana or Ethereum address) to their Nerdwork+ account via 
this service. The Wallet service securely stores references to public wallet addresses (never 
private keys) and perhaps an index of assets relevant to the platform. For example, it can detect 
if a user’s linked wallet owns certain NFTs that grant special access. It might use blockchain 
APIs or indexers (via third-party like Magicblock or Helio if they provide such data) to query 
token ownership. This service also handles wallet-centric actions: initiating on-chain 
transactions (when needed) and verifying signatures if the platform allows users to sign in or 
perform actions by signing messages with their wallet. However, since Nerdwork+ uses Helio for 
payments, the Wallet service often delegates actual crypto transactions to Helio’s SDK or API – 
focusing instead on maintaining the association between Nerdwork+ user accounts and 
blockchain identities. In essence, the Wallet microservice is the bridge between Web2 user data 
and Web3 crypto data, ensuring the platform knows which user corresponds to which on-chain 
address and what privileges or assets that entails. 
6. Payment Service 
Facilitates all payment transactions on the platform, specifically crypto payments via Helio 
integration. Helio is a Web3 payment gateway that allows instant, low-fee crypto checkouts on 
websites. The Payment service uses Helio’s API to create payment requests (e.g. when a user 
buys a premium comic, tips a creator, or makes any purchase in crypto). It might generate a 
Helio payment link or embed, which the frontend uses to let the user pay with their crypto wallet. 
Upon payment completion, Helio will notify via a webhook – the Payment service processes 
these callbacks, verifies the transaction (amount, payer, item), and updates internal records 
(mark an order as paid, unlock content for the user, etc.). This service also keeps a ledger of 
transactions in a database: recording who paid what, when, and for which item, to enable 
receipts and handle any disputes or support issues. It can convert crypto to an internal currency 
or simply record values in crypto terms depending on business logic. The Payment service 
communicates with other services on certain events: e.g., after a successful purchase, it might 
notify the Comic service (to grant access to a paid comic), the Loyalty service (to award points 
for a purchase), and the NFT service (if the purchase included minting an NFT reward). By 
centralizing payment logic, Nerdwork+ can easily swap or extend payment providers (though 
Helio is the primary, one could add fiat gateways later) without affecting other services. 
7. Loyalty Service 
Manages the loyalty and rewards system, integrated via Verxio for XP points and tier tracking. 
Verxio is a platform (or API service) that handles gamified loyalty programs – think points, 
levels, badges. The Loyalty microservice uses Verxio’s API to create and update user loyalty 
records. For example, when a user reads comics, leaves reviews, or makes purchases, the 
Loyalty service is notified (via events or direct calls) and will increment that user’s XP or points 
in Verxio. Verxio likely provides the logic for tier thresholds (e.g. 0–1000 XP = Bronze, 
1000–5000 = Silver, etc.) and perhaps stores the cumulative points. The Loyalty service acts as 
the glue between Nerdwork+ events and the Verxio system: it translates internal events (“user 
read chapter 5”) into Verxio API calls (“add 10 XP to user123”). It also retrieves loyalty status for 
display – e.g., fetching a user’s current tier and points to show in their profile. To ensure 
performance and availability, the Loyalty service might cache some data (e.g. store the last 
known points locally in DynamoDB or memory) and update asynchronously. This service is 
critical for user engagement, so it also can trigger notifications – for instance, if a user levels up 
to a new tier, the Loyalty service could inform the Notification service to send a congratulatory 
email. By keeping loyalty logic separate, Nerdwork+ can modify how rewards are calculated or 
integrate a different loyalty provider with minimal impact on other components. 
8. NFT Service 
Handles all things NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens), especially minting and tracking NFTs via 
Magicblock integration. Magicblock is a platform that helps developers create high-speed Web3 
apps (particularly on Solana) as if they were Web2 – likely providing an API or SDK to mint 
NFTs efficiently. The NFT microservice uses Magicblock to mint new tokens when needed: for 
example, minting a limited-edition NFT for a comic issue cover, or a reward NFT when a user 
reaches a certain loyalty tier. The process involves preparing metadata (often JSON with 
attributes, images, etc.), storing that metadata via the File service on IPFS/Pinata, then calling 
Magicblock’s minting API to create the token on the blockchain (Solana or others). This service 
also keeps references of minted NFTs in a database: token IDs, the associated user (owner) or 
comic, and metadata links. It might also verify ownership for certain features – e.g., if a comic is 
gated to NFT holders, the NFT service can confirm a user’s wallet holds the required token. 
Magicblock’s platform likely ensures the NFT creation is scalable and “feels like Web2” for 
performance. The NFT service ensures that Web3 elements (like digital collectibles, proof of 
ownership of content) are smoothly integrated. Security is paramount: any keys or signatures 
used for minting are kept secure (potentially using AWS KMS to sign transactions if not fully 
delegated to Magicblock). By abstracting NFT operations here, the rest of the platform can 
simply request “mint NFT for X” or query “does user Y own NFT Z?” from this service without 
dealing with blockchain intricacies. 
9. Notification Service 
Responsible for user notifications and communications. This covers transactional emails 
(sign-up confirmations, password resets via Auth service, receipts via Payment service), as well 
as engagement notifications (new comic releases, loyalty tier upgrades, announcements). It 
integrates with AWS Simple Email Service (SES) to send emails reliably. For on-platform 
notifications, if Nerdwork+ has a web or mobile app with notification feeds, this service would 
write those messages to a notifications database and provide an API for the client to fetch them. 
The Notification service receives inputs from other services: e.g., the Comic service might 
trigger a “new chapter” notification to subscribers of that comic; the Loyalty service might trigger 
an email when a user reaches a new tier; Auth service triggers verification or welcome emails. 
Using a message queue or event bus, these events can be picked up by the Notification service 
asynchronously to send out messages without slowing down the original action. This service 
also manages user preferences for notifications (e.g., allow users to opt out of certain email 
types to comply with regulations). It ensures all communications are templated, localized if 
needed, and consistent in style. By centralizing outbound notifications, Nerdwork+ can easily 
change email templates or switch providers (e.g. using a different email API) in one place. 
Security-wise, it keeps email sending within AWS (SES) to avoid external leaks, and it monitors 
bounce/spam rates to keep the system healthy. 
10. Analytics Service 
Provides analytics and monitoring of platform usage and business metrics. This microservice 
collects events and data from across Nerdwork+: page views, read counts, purchase 
conversions, user retention stats, etc. At the 0–10k user scale, this might be implemented with a 
combination of lightweight real-time processing and batch analysis. For instance, the Analytics 
service could expose an endpoint for other services to send events (e.g., “event=ComicOpened, 
user=123, comic=456”) or subscribe to an event stream. It then logs these events into a data 
store optimized for analytics – options include Amazon DynamoDB for a simple key-value event 
log, Amazon OpenSearch or Redshift for more complex querying, or even plain files in S3 
analyzed by AWS Athena for cost efficiency. Initially, DynamoDB can handle a large number of 
events with minimal ops (and free tier capacity covers millions of requests). The service can 
also perform aggregations: e.g., calculating daily active users, or computing the most read 
comics. These summaries can be stored in an analytics database or cache for quick retrieval by 
dashboards. The Analytics service does not need to be synchronous – it often works off a queue 
or stream, ensuring it doesn’t slow user-facing operations. Importantly, it anonymizes and 
aggregates data to respect privacy (no personal info in raw analytics logs unless necessary, and 
if so, protected per GDPR guidelines). This service might provide an internal dashboard for 
admins or feed data to external BI tools. By isolating analytics, any heavy data processing or 
future machine learning tasks (like recommending comics) can be implemented without 
impacting the performance of core user-facing services. 
Service Interaction and Overall SaaS Architecture 
High-level architecture: the user interface is delivered via Amazon CloudFront and S3, with an 
API tier behind a gateway or load balancer routing to containerized microservices on ECS. Each 
microservice uses its own data store suitable to its needs (e.g. Amazon Aurora for relational 
data, DynamoDB for NoSQL/Key-Value), ensuring loose coupling and independent scaling. 
All microservices operate within a cohesive SaaS architecture. The user interface (front-end 
web app) is likely a static single-page application (SPA) built in JavaScript/TypeScript, which is 
hosted on Amazon S3 and delivered via CloudFront CDN for global low-latency access. Users 
load this front-end in their browser, which then communicates with the back-end microservices 
via APIs. 
An API Gateway (or alternatively, an Application Load Balancer) serves as the single entry point 
for all client API requests. This gateway routes calls to the appropriate microservice based on 
the URL path or request attributes (for example, requests to /api/comics/* go to the Comic 
service, /api/auth/* go to Auth service, etc.). Using one unified API gateway for all services 
simplifies the external interface and is cost-effective for a small-scale system. The gateway also 
offloads concerns like request throttling, authentication (it can verify JWTs or Cognito tokens 
before routing), and response caching for common requests. 
Internal communication between microservices follows a mix of synchronous and asynchronous 
patterns: 
Synchronous calls (REST/gRPC): If one service needs data from another in real-time (for 
example, the Comic service asking the User service for profile info to attach to a comic 
comment), it can call the other service’s API over the internal network. However, to maintain 
loose coupling, such calls are minimized. Instead, many cross-service interactions use events. 
Asynchronous messaging: Nerdwork+ implements a messaging system (e.g. AWS SNS topics 
or EventBridge bus, and SQS queues) to broadcast events and decouple processes. When 
something notable happens in one service, it publishes an event like PaymentCompleted, 
ComicRead, or UserSignedUp. Other services that care about that event can subscribe and 
react independently. For instance, upon PaymentCompleted (by Payment service), the Loyalty 
service could award points and the NFT service could initiate minting a reward NFT – all without 
the Payment service needing to directly call those services. This event-driven approach 
improves scalability and fault tolerance: services can be added or changed without modifying 
the core logic of the emitter. The system may use Amazon EventBridge for a serverless event 
bus or SNS for pub/sub, with each subscribing microservice processing events via a lightweight 
Lambda or polling queue. 
Each microservice has its own database or data store, aligning with the database-per-service 
pattern. This means no shared monolithic database, but rather each service chooses the 
optimal storage for its data: the Auth/User services might use Amazon Aurora 
(MySQL/Postgres) as a relational user store, the Comic service could use Aurora or a 
combination of Aurora and DynamoDB (for fast lookups of comic pages or caching popular 
content), the Analytics service might use DynamoDB or S3 (for large-scale log storage), etc. 
This isolation ensures loose coupling – changes in one service’s schema don’t impact others, 
and each microservice can scale or optimize its database independently. It also enhances 
security by limiting the blast radius of a data breach and enables different compliance measures 
per data type. For small scale, these databases might be small slices on a single RDS instance 
or separate schemas, but still logically separated. In some cases, services may share an 
instance for cost, but through separate schemas/tables and strict access controls (a middle 
ground known as shared database per service with careful data domain isolation if absolutely 
needed to save cost). 
The API Gateway communicates with microservices running on AWS ECS (Elastic Container 
Service) or AWS Lambda. In Nerdwork+, most core services are long-running containers on 
ECS Fargate (which requires zero server maintenance and can scale down to zero if 
configured, though typically one task minimum keeps the service active). ECS tasks reside in a 
private VPC subnet. For less-demanding or infrequent tasks, some services might instead run 
as serverless AWS Lambda functions, triggered via API Gateway or events. For example, the 
Analytics service might use a Lambda to handle event ingestion from EventBridge, and the 
Notification service might use Lambdas for sending emails from an SQS queue of messages – 
this avoids keeping idle servers for spiky workloads and is cost-efficient under low usage. AWS 
Lambda’s integration with API Gateway allows an API endpoint to directly invoke a function and 
return a result, which is a pattern used in the initial version of our platform for certain endpoints 
(Node.js functions behind API Gateway, as seen in similar SaaS implementations). 
The web client interacts with the back-end strictly via the API Gateway endpoints (RESTful 
JSON APIs or GraphQL, depending on design). There is no direct cross-origin call to individual 
microservice addresses – everything is unified under the gateway domain for simplicity and 
security. This also simplifies applying security measures like WAF (Web Application Firewall) at 
a single entry point.
